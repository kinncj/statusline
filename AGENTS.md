# AGENTS.md — kinncj statusline

This repo is a portable two-line statusline for AI CLIs (Claude Code, OpenCode, GitHub Copilot CLI) plus AGENTS.md / skill installers for tools that lack a scriptable statusline (Pi, Hermes).

If you are an AI agent working on this repo, read this file first — every host that supports AGENTS.md will load it automatically. The instructions below apply regardless of which CLI you are running under.

## What the statusline does

It reads JSON from stdin (the host's session info) and prints two lines:

```
dir: <dirname> | branch: <git-branch> | think:<effort>
context: <pct>% (<used>/<size>, <left> left) | <ccusage cost block> | 5h quota: ... | 7d quota: ...
```

Segments self-suppress when their data isn't present. Line 1 covers identity. Line 2 covers usage and budget.

## Repo layout

```
statusline.sh                    # the script itself — single source of truth
install.sh                       # orchestrator (detects tools, dispatches)
installers/
  _lib.sh                        # shared bash helpers (run, json_set, copy_statusline)
  claude-code.sh                 # wires ~/.claude/settings.json
  opencode.sh                    # wires ~/.config/opencode/opencode.json
  copilot-cli.sh                 # wires ~/.copilot/settings.json
  pi.sh                          # AGENTS.md only (no statusline hook)
  hermes.sh                      # AGENTS.md + skill (no statusline hook)
.claude/agents/                  # Claude Code project-scoped agents
.claude/skills/                  # Claude Code project-scoped skills
.opencode/agents/                # OpenCode project-scoped agents
tests/                           # mock-JSON inputs for testing the script
```

## Host support status (verified vs. aspirational)

Be honest in user-facing docs about which of these installers is wiring something that actually works:

| Tool         | Statusline hook support     | Notes |
|--------------|-----------------------------|-------|
| Claude Code  | ✓ shipped                   | `settings.json.statusLine = {type:"command", command, padding}` — official. |
| Copilot CLI  | ✓ shipped                   | Config lives in `~/.copilot/config.json`. The neighbouring `settings.json` is read for unrelated user prefs and a misleading header comment ("User settings belong in settings.json") — its `statusLine` key is **ignored**. Requires the experimental feature gate, which we persist with `"experimental": true` in the same file (equivalent to launching `copilot --experimental`). The `command` path must be **absolute** (no `~`, no env var expansion) and the script must be executable with a valid shebang. config.json starts with `//` comment lines that jq can't parse — installer strips them before merging. Verified against Copilot CLI 1.0.46 and griches/copilot-hud's setup skill. |
| OpenCode     | ⚠ not shipped               | Feature request open at anomalyco/opencode#8619. Our installer writes `.statusline` and `.experimental.statusline` keys speculatively so a future ship lands without a re-install. Today the runtime ignores them; the AGENTS.md drop is what carries weight. |
| Pi           | ✓ shipped (native extension)| `~/.pi/agent/extensions/kinncj-statusline/` — an `ExtensionFactory` (`statusline.mjs`) that subscribes to `session_start`/`turn_end`/`tool_execution_end`/`agent_end`/`model_select`, synthesizes a Claude-shaped payload from `ctx.cwd` + `ctx.model` + `ctx.getContextUsage()`, execs the sibling `statusline.sh`, and renders the stdout as a multi-line widget under the editor via `ctx.ui.setWidget(key, lines, {placement:"belowEditor"})`. Auto-discovered by Pi from `<agentDir>/extensions/` — no settings to edit. Renders below Pi's native footer rather than replacing it, so both lines coexist. Verified against `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` 0.73.1 (formerly `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent`). |
| Hermes       | ✗ no scriptable statusline  | Built-in TUI; only `display.tui_status_indicator` is tunable. AGENTS.md + skill only. |

If you change an installer to wire something new, verify against the upstream tool's released schema first and update this table.

## Host JSON schemas (what stdin looks like)

The statusline's `jq -r '… // empty'` filters mean missing fields silently render nothing — but the *shape* differs per host. When adding or debugging a segment, confirm the key path against the host you're targeting:

| Field                                            | Claude Code | OpenCode | Copilot CLI |
|--------------------------------------------------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| `.cwd`                                           | ✓           | ✓        | ✓           |
| `.session_id` / `.session_name`                  | —           | ?        | ✓           |
| `.model.display_name`                            | ✓           | ✓        | ✓           |
| `.transcript_path` (Claude: file; Copilot: dir)  | ✓ file      | ✓ file   | ✓ directory |
| `.context_window.used_percentage`                | ✓           | ✓        | ✓ but `null` on auto-routed free models |
| `.context_window.context_window_size`            | ✓           | ✓        | ✓ but `null` on auto-routed free models |
| `.context_window.current_context_used_percentage`| —           | —        | ✓ (Copilot fallback) |
| `.context_window.displayed_context_limit`        | —           | —        | ✓ (Copilot fallback) |
| `.context_window.current_context_tokens`         | —           | —        | ✓ live working set |
| `.context_window.total_input_tokens`             | ✓           | ✓        | ✓           |
| `.context_window.total_output_tokens`            | ✓           | ✓        | ✓           |
| `.cost.total_premium_requests` (fractional)      | —           | —        | ✓           |
| `.cost.total_lines_added` / `total_lines_removed`| —           | —        | ✓           |
| `.cost.total_api_duration_ms`                    | —           | —        | ✓ API wall time |
| `.cost.total_duration_ms`                        | —           | —        | ✓ session wall time |
| `.rate_limits.{five_hour,seven_day}.*`           | ✓ (Pro/Max) | —        | —           |
| `.thinking.enabled` / `.effort.level`            | ✓           | ?        | —           |

Copilot's context block toggles between two semantic modes within a single session:
- **Premium model active** (e.g. `claude-opus-4.7`): primary fields populate (`used_percentage`, `context_window_size`, `remaining_tokens`).
- **Auto-routed to a free model** (e.g. `Auto → GPT-5.3-Codex`): primary fields go `null`; only `current_context_*` and `displayed_context_limit` are set. The statusline chains `used_percentage // current_context_used_percentage` and `context_window_size // displayed_context_limit` so the block keeps rendering across both modes.

Copilot does **not** ship `rate_limits` (its "Remaining reqs.: N%" footer is computed from a separate channel not exposed to `statusLine`), and does not ship `thinking` / `effort` in the JSON payload (effort is a launch-time CLI flag, not a per-render field).

Pi and Hermes do not pipe JSON to a statusline script — they have no such hook.

## Conventions when editing `statusline.sh`

These are not stylistic preferences — they are bug guardrails that bit us already:

1. **Always use `printf '%b' "..."` to emit the final line** — never `printf "$line"`. A literal `%` (e.g. in `ctx:12%`) crashes a format-string `printf`. The `%b` form treats the argument as data and still interprets `\033[…m` escapes.
2. **Don't strip ANSI escapes with `${var#$SEP}`** — `[` in escape codes is a glob char. Build raw (no-SEP) versions of each block instead, and add `${SEP}` only at join time.
3. **Every `jq` lookup gets `// empty`** so a missing field renders the segment empty, never the literal string `"null"`.
4. **Gate ccusage output**: skip it on `❌` or `Invalid` substrings — `ccusage` prints diagnostic errors to stdout when its input shape doesn't match.
5. **Color escalation for percentages**: green <50 → yellow 50-79 → red ≥80. Apply to context % and any future quota that has a budget.
6. **Label costs as `API-est:`** — they're API list-price estimates, not what Claude.ai subscribers actually pay. Don't drop the label.
7. **Segments self-suppress**: every block starts with `block=""` and only gets a value if its source data is present. Never emit a block whose value would be empty.

## Testing changes

### statusline.sh

Mock JSON inputs live in `tests/`. To run the script against one:

```bash
cat tests/fixture-claude-code.json | bash statusline.sh
# or strip ANSI for plain-text diff
cat tests/fixture-claude-code.json | bash statusline.sh | sed 's/\x1b\[[0-9;]*m//g'
```

### installer + TUI (bats)

Installer tests live in `tests/installers/` and use [bats-core](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core). Each test runs against a fake `$HOME` so the user's real config is never touched.

```bash
# Install bats once (CachyOS: pacman -S bats, Debian: apt install bats, macOS: brew install bats-core)
tests/run.sh                  # all tests
tests/run.sh claude-code      # files matching a substring
bats tests/installers/*.bats  # bats directly
```

Conventions when adding tests:
- Always call `setup_fake_home` in `setup()` and `teardown_fake_home` in `teardown()`.
- Use `run_installer <name>` to drive a single installer; use `run_install <flags>` for the dispatcher.
- Assert filesystem state and `jq` queries against the resulting JSON — not on log strings, which change as the TUI evolves.

When ccusage is in play, it requires a real transcript file. For a hermetic test, stub it:

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/sl-stub
cat > /tmp/sl-stub/npx <<'STUB'
#!/usr/bin/env bash
cat >/dev/null
printf '%s' '🤖 Test Model | 💰 $1.00 session / $0.00 today / $5.00 block (3h left) | 🔥 $10/hr | 🧠 50,000 (5%)'
STUB
chmod +x /tmp/sl-stub/npx
PATH="/tmp/sl-stub:$PATH" bash statusline.sh < tests/fixture-claude-code.json
```

## Installing

```bash
./install.sh                     # interactive, all detected tools
./install.sh --all               # non-interactive
./install.sh --target opencode   # specific tool (repeatable)
./install.sh --dry-run           # show what would happen
./install.sh --uninstall         # remove wiring (statusline.sh in repo is untouched)
```

The installer is idempotent: running it twice just rewrites the same paths.

## When changing the install surface

If you add a new tool installer, do all of:

1. Drop `installers/<tool>.sh` (executable, sources `_lib.sh` which transitively sources `_tui.sh`).
2. Add `<tool>)` to `detect()` and `KNOWN_TOOLS` in `install.sh`.
3. Update both tables above — host support status AND stdin schema (or note it has no statusline hook).
4. Update `README.md` with the user-facing description.
5. Add a `tests/installers/<tool>.bats` covering install + uninstall + jq assertions against the resulting JSON.
6. Test with `--dry-run --target <tool>` and run `tests/run.sh`.

## TUI helpers

`installers/_tui.sh` provides the animated logo, box drawing, and section banners used by `install.sh`. Anything user-facing that produces formatted output goes through it.

Knobs the helpers honor:
- `NO_COLOR=1` — disables all color escapes (per https://no-color.org).
- `TUI_NO_ANIM=1` — skips animations, prints final frames instantly. `install.sh --no-animation` sets this.
- Non-TTY stdout — both color and animation auto-disable, so piping the installer into a log file stays clean.

Per-installer scripts should call `ok` / `warn` / `err` / `info` (mapped to the indented variants from `_tui.sh`) so output lines up inside the section box.

## Tone for end-user-facing strings

Installer output is short and direct. `ok` / `warn` / `err` / `info` helpers in `_lib.sh` cover the four levels. No emoji in installer messages — they're for the statusline itself, where they're decorative and meaningful (💰 cost, 🔥 burn, 🤖 model).
